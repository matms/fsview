# Credit where Credit is Due

`CMakeLists.txt` was adapted from https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-with-CMake and https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/projects/CMake/CMakeLists.txt

Also, raylib documentation was consulted frequently, see https://www.raylib.com/ and https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html. C++ docs were also consulted.

Example starter code (https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/examples/core/core_basic_window.c) was consulted for information on creation and management of windows using raylib.
